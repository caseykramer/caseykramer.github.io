This is a plug-in I created primarily as a tool to aid in working in a TDD environment, but which certainly has uses for non-TDD applications. It does basically what the name suggests, it allows you to move a file from one directory in your solution/project structure to another, even one in a different project.</description></item><item><title>Getting a CodeRush: Inside a CodeRush CodeIssue</title><link>http://drrandom.org/2009/10/07/getting-a-coderush-inside-a-coderush-codeissue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2009 17:22:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://drrandom.org/2009/10/07/getting-a-coderush-inside-a-coderush-codeissue/</guid><description>Anyone who has been around me for more than a few hours while coding, or who pays any attention to me on Twitter will know that I am a huge fan of CodeRush and Refactor Pro! from DevExpress . I consider these sorts of tools essential to getting the most out of your development environment, and I think CodeRush is one of the best tools available for a number of reasons, not the least of which is it&amp;rsquo;s extensibility.</description></item></channel></rss>
