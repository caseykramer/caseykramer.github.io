This means that we typically don&amp;rsquo;t want a single story to go longer than one week. We also change up the pair rotation once per week. The estimation process is not perfect, though, and we have a lot of support from management to choose doing things right, rather than doing things now, which leads to stories going beyond a single iteration. So when this happens, there is usually a small rock/paper/scissors session with the developers involved to determine who will be taking the story.</description></item></channel></rss>
