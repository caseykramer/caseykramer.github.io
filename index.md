### Celebrities and Fame
The undead have been treated poorly ever since all the horror films and TV shows 
where zombies are the ones in the wrong. We at S.H.O.E have been trying to make 
films and shows where the zombies are the OPPOSITE role. 
U.N. Dead, director of the successful zombie TV show, _The Big Brain Theory_  
agrees with this statement.

> _The Big Brain Theory_ was  the only successful TV show that allows the Exanimated 
> beings to get a chance as the heroes.

U.N. Dead told _S.H.O.E Daily_,  our community Magazine, 

> But thanks to S.H.O.E, there are more such as _How I Ate Your Mother_, 
> _The Deadsoons_ and _Rick and Mort_.  Books now have also been featured 
> such as _The Hungry Games_ series, _Charlotte’s Dead_ and _Harry Cut-Off, The Boy Undead_. 

So in conclusion, Zombies have been gaining fame in books and TV Shows 
just like humans have, yet not quite as dumb.
                              

Songs have been written as well as books and TV shows. It is injustice that exanimate 
beings are unable to publish their pieces of music yet humans are able to publish their 
music and get fame,attention and the spotlight whilst zombies are outcasted. 
Dead Sheeran has told _S.H.O.E Daily_, 

> I have written many songs such as _Undead You_, _Don't Eat Hearts Around Here_, 
> and _Perfectly Dead_. I am overjoyed that *S.H.O.E Tunes* has let me put those 
> songs and many other albums around the zombie community. Noose Gallagher has 
> also released songs with his band, _High Flying Brains_ like _Don’t Kill Them In Anger_, 
> _Stop Eating Their Hearts Out_ and _Live For Never_. 

_High Flying Brains’s  tickets are being sold to both humans and zombies alike for £33.00 
at Cardiff Stadium on October the 31st. So be sure to check them out or download their 
albums on *S.H.O.E Tunes* for free.
