As of today I have updated several things on the site.  First, I have a new hosting provider, [WinHost ](1).  This was primarily a financial decision (saving $3.03 a month, not a lot but hey, every little bit helps, right?), but it looks like there are some nice technical advantages to switching as well.  Some of these are things like IIS 7 hosting, and SQL Server access.  Also you get unlimited domain name pointers, so the [IThinkIn.Net ](2) domain that I registered a few years back and could never wire up is now live.  While I was in the process of moving to a new server I also updated to the latest version of dasBlog, seeing as I was still running the original .Net 2.0 version from sometime in early 2006 (I think).  I’m not sure whether there will be any immediate signs of new and exciting things, but you never know.  You should now be able to utilize [Gravatar ](3) icons, and [OpenID ](4), so it can’t be all bad right?

Please contact me if for any reason there is an issue with any of the content.  As far as I know everything moved over without a hitch, but I’ve not verified everything at this point.
