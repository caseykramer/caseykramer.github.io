I recently ran across an intranet reporting app which required IE6 (or, I should say, would not work with IE7 or FireFox 2).  I upgraded to IE7 originally after numerous javascript errors, and a desire to check out CardSpace, and thus far had not had too many problems.  This was a potential issue, however.

Fortunately there is a ready made solution: Multiple IE's.  This little gem is a single installer, which will allow you to install any version of IE from 3 through 6 in it's own folder so it does not interfere with the default install.  You can pick it up at <http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE>
