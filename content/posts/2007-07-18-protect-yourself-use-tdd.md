So I had this analogy pop into my head a while back and I've been sitting on it because, quite frankly, I was almost embarrassed to have thought of it.  I finally decided that I might as well post it since no one is going to read this anyway, so here goes:

Writing software without TDD is like having unprotected sex.  Its extremely irresponsible in this day and age when everyone is supposed to know better, but it still happens a lot.  Sure, it feels better, and let's face it in the heat of the moment you really don't want

 to take the time to make sure you've taken all of the right precautions...you might loose your edge.  The problem is if we don't do it we have that lingering fear in the back of our minds, that &#8220;What if?&#8221; that keeps popping up at the worst moments.  Most of the time its okay, and everything is fine, but it only takes one time for things to go wrong to make you regret your decisions.

      So come on folks, we all know what we should be doing, so no more making excuses.  After a while you get used to it, and you find that the peace of mind it gives you far outweighs the momentary delights of living on the wild side.
