My wife and I have decided to try and put together a PVR box to make life a little easier.  With Lana getting old enough to pay attention to grown-up TV, and the fact that there are 4 shows we like to watch that happen at the same time, it seems appropriate (not to mention being able to record Sesame Street for the baby).

So here is what I’ve figured out so far:

Linux-Based PVR using [MythTV ](1).

Pretty good eh?  So now for the hard part: Hardware.  So far I’m looking at the [WinTV ](2) cards with the hardware encoding/decoding.  They are fairly reasonably priced, and fairly well supported.

I’m also looking at the rather sharp [SilverStone LC03V ](3) home theater component case.

Not much info yet, but I’ll be keeping notes here as I go along and decide what will work best.
