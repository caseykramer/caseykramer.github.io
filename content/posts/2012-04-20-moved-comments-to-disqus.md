As of yesterday the comments on the blog here are now officially hosted by Disqus. If anyone has tried leaving comments in the past only to have them never show up (or disappear at some point), I apologize for that. The spam was a little crazy....and by a little crazy I mean effing insane, It got to the point where I was unable to separate the wheat from the chaff, and went through a couple different strategies to try and get things under control...Disqus is the latest (and hopefully last) of these strategies.

So I hope you enjoy the new and improved, and not quite so spammy comment system.
