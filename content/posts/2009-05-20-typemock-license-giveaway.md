[Unit Testing ](1) ASP.NET? [ASP.NET unit testing ](2) has never been this easy.

Typemock is launching a new product for ASP.NET developers – the **ASP.NET Bundle** &#8211; and for the launch will be giving out <span style="color:#006600;"><strong>FREE licenses</strong></span> to bloggers and their readers.

The ASP.NET Bundle is the ultimate ASP.NET unit testing solution, and offers both [Typemock Isolator ](1), a [unit test ](1) tool and [Ivonna ](3), the Isolator add-on for [ASP.NET unit testing ](3), for a bargain price.

Typemock Isolator is a leading [.NET unit testing ](1) tool (C# and VB.NET) for many ‘hard to test’ technologies such as [SharePoint ](4), [ASP.NET ](2), [MVC ](2), [WCF ](5), WPF, [Silverlight ](6) and more. Note that for [unit testing Silverlight ](6) there is an open source Isolator add-on called [SilverUnit ](6).

The first 60 bloggers who will blog this text in their blog and [tell us about it ](8), will get a Free Isolator ASP.NET Bundle license (Typemock Isolator + Ivonna). If you post this in an ASP.NET **dedicated** blog, you'll get a license automatically (even if more than 60 submit) during the first week of this announcement.

Also 8 bloggers will get an **additional 2 licenses** (each) to give away to their readers
